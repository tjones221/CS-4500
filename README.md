PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND REMEDIATION:
====================================

    PART 0: SET UP
    ==============


    PART 1: LINKED LIST
    ===================
    Function: create_list()
    - Problem:
    - Solution:

    Function: add_to_list()
    - Problem: Problem Areas include understanding linked lists, the function of structs, and connecting the list to the node.
    - Solution: When attempting to make the “add_to_list” function, distinguishing the last element and understanding the method 
    to connect the list and node were difficult tasks.  The “item” variable, “next” variable, and “head” variable are elements 
    needed to move through the linked list, but each variable is in a different Structs . To connect the elements for the linked 
    list, you need a current variable of the type node that is pointing to the head element of the list. With this extension, 
    the user now knows of what the leading item is and can move to the next item with knowledge of what is happening.
