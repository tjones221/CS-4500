//This file should test your list implementation.  Your test file should try various combinations 
//of your create list, add to list, remove from list, flush list, print list, and free listfunctions.
//Note the difference between flush listand free list: after  calling  flush list,  your  
//list  ll still  points  to  a  valid,  empty  list  (like  a  brand  new list  whose  head  points  to  NULL);
