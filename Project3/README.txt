Part 2
=============================
This programming problem was tricky and complex to complete. I used many online sources and utilized ChatGPT to help me format my thoughts properly when creating the threads. The base of my function is a combination of two main sources that helped me understand where to start with building the threads:

Source 1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6487470/c-circular-character-buffer-w-pthreads

Source 2: https://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/139144-circular-character-buffer-pthreads-mutex-cond-deadlock-help.html

I learned that when working with a circular queue and threads, indexing is very important to keep track of. I made the mistake of not indexing properly, which caused recurring errors that would crash my program. To solve this issue, I reread the sources mentioned above and asked ChatGPT questions related to threads and the faulty logic in my code.
